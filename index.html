      <h1>What Is This About?</h1>
    <p>
      The writer strike was an event that took place from May 2nd to September 11th. The writers threatned to go on strike if an agrrement with The Alliance of Motion Picture and Telivison Producers wasn't met. They sadly didnt and thats when writers decided to goon strike because of the unfairness. It was an event that had a huge impact on actors, producers, and directors.

    <h1>Why Should We Care?</h1>
  <p>
  The writers strike didnt allow actors to promote thier new projects, whether that is movies or tv shoes, to the public eye. With this people coulnt see their favorite actors or prducers work. Not inly this, but it also stopped TV shows from being produced or continued. This leads to some peoples favorite shows or movies being ended permantly. Some peopel find joy in this topic, and especially brings joy yo people who make a living out of it which is why we should care.
